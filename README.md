# Spidir
A Python script which can parse a directory listing webpage using parsers and download all files on the page.

## Getting Started
Run `main.py` and follow the instructions given by the script. Then wait until the download is completed.

It is recommended to run the script on a server if your files are too big.

## Add Another Parser
If you want to download files from other sources, try to make a parser by yourself! Once you have done that, you can put your own parser under `parsers/` and choose it from the program.

See `parsers/webarchive.py` for more about how to make a parser.
